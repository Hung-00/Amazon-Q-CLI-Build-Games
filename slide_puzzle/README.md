# Amazon-Q Slide Puzzle Game Prompt

1. The slide puzzle, sometimes referred to as the "15 puzzle" or "Gem Puzzle", was first created by Noyes Palmer Chapman in 1874. Number Slide Puzzle (15 Puzzle) has a grid with numbered tiles where the player needs to order the tiles from 1 to the maximum number (such as 1 to 15 in a 4x4 grid). Typically, the numbers are arranged in a sequence, but there's one empty space that allows the tiles to move. In this folder, I want you to create a 2d Number Slide Puzzle (15 Puzzle) game using PyGame library.

2. Here are something you need to update the slide puzzle game:
   1. Give the player an option to choose 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6 grid. Give me an option to go back to the main menu when I'm in the game.
   2. In the main menu, give the player the option to choose the image for the grid, make the grid into image-based grid. You will split the picture into pieces and make them become the tiles in the playground. The bottom right pieces will be removed.
   3. Add some simple sound effects for sliding effects.
