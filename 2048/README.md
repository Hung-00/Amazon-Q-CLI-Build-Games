1. 2048 is a popular single-player puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. In this folder, I want you to create a 2D free kick game using PyGame library.

2. Here are something you need to update:
   1. Update the grid to 8x8. Update the condition to win the game to 8192.
   2. Increase the speed of tile's sliding effect. Change the code to wait for all sliding effects end then the new tile can appear.
   3. Move all the title, how-to-play and score section to the left side of the window. Make sure this section not cover the game grid.
   4. Add some simple sound effects.
