1. Pac-Man is one of the most iconic and influential arcade games of all time. It was developed by Namco and first released in 1980.. In this folder, I want you to create a Pac-Man-inspired game using PyGame library.

1. Here are something you need to update:
   1. Make the route smaller, right now the route is too wide, like you can turn left or right, make it smaller so that you can only go straight and turn at corner only.
   2. Decrease the quantity of power-up dot, increase the duration of power-up.
   3. Make the map bigger and add more corner.
   4. Add some simple sound effects.
